## What is Pars?
<p align="justify">
Often people have trouble programming in C++ (especially beginners) due to its low level syntax and unavailability of stable third party libraries. We present pars a high-level front end for C++ which creates a dynamically typed syntax for C++. User can write code in this high level syntax and then compile it to optimized C++ code. pars does not process the code and simply translates it to C++ thus, there is no possibility of the code running slowly. So, with pars users can write code faster using the high level syntax and at the same time be able to harness the power and speed of a C++ program. Let us make C++ cool again.
